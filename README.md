# Smart Home and Crop Monitoring System

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Smart Home and Crop Monitoring System** using Cisco Packet Tracer. It integrates IoT technology to automate and manage home appliances and agricultural systems efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Motion Detection & Security Alerts**: Activates alarms and cameras upon detecting unauthorized activity.  
- **Temperature-Controlled Devices**: Automates air conditioners and furnaces based on room temperature.  
- **RFID-Based Door Locks**: Secures doors with RFID authentication.  
- **Automated Irrigation**: Controls lawn sprinklers based on soil moisture levels.  
- **Fire Safety Mechanisms**: CO2 detectors and sprinklers respond to fire hazards.

## Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Simulation and configuration of IoT devices.  
- **IoT Devices**: Smart sensors, actuators, and controllers integrated with a centralized IoT server.

## How to Use
1. Download the Packet Tracer file from this repository.  
2. Open the file in Cisco Packet Tracer.  
3. Explore and simulate various smart home and crop monitoring features.
