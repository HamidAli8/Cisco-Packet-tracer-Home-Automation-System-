# Smart Home and Crop Monitoring System

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Smart Home and Crop Monitoring System** using Cisco Packet Tracer. It integrates IoT technology to automate and manage home appliances and agricultural systems efficiently.

## Key Features
- **Motion Detection & Security Alerts**: Activates alarms and cameras upon detecting unauthorized activity.  
- **Temperature-Controlled Devices**: Automates air conditioners and furnaces based on room temperature.  
- **RFID-Based Door Locks**: Secures doors with RFID authentication.  
- **Automated Irrigation**: Controls lawn sprinklers based on soil moisture levels.  
- **Fire Safety Mechanisms**: CO2 detectors and sprinklers respond to fire hazards.

## Technologies Used
- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: Simulation and configuration of IoT devices.  
- **IoT Devices**: Smart sensors, actuators, and controllers integrated with a centralized IoT server.
